\section{Discussion}

As we can see there is no speedup with array size less than $10000$ elements because this amount of data is too small to compensate the overheads created by the use of threads.\\

For arrays of $10000$ and $100000$ elements, there is an improvement at the begining but after a certain number of threads ($8$ for $10000$ and $32$ for $100000$) the speedup starts to decrease, due to the effects of the overheads.\\

With arrays bigger than $100000$ elements, the speedup keeps increasing but we see that the speedup follow a logarithmic pattern. It is easy to conjecture that the speedup will increase slowly as we add new threads up to a certain point where there will be too many threads. At that moment, the speedup will likely start to decrease.
