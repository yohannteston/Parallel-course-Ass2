\chapter{Problem description}

The goal of this assignment is to set up a parallel version of the quicksort algorithm.

The general algorithm for that is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Select the pivot element
  \item Divide the data into two sets (smaller and greater than the pivot)
  \item Recursively call the Quick-sort 
\end{itemize}

We chose to parallelize this algorithm by spawning a new thread each time the data are divided. So, the behavior of our algorithm is basically the same as the serial except that a thread is created to treat the data greater than the pivot (while the existing thread computes the data smaller than the pivot using a recursive call).
